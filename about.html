										<p>Fitness has always been my passion. From running relay races in grade school to running track at UW Milwaukee. I have always believed growing up that, “Practice brings Perseverance, so Persevere through Practice“. After having a knee injury playing football my junior year in high school. I was determined to battle back to run track my senior year. So I persevered through my open knee surgery and physical therapy to make it up state to the tack and field champions for the 200 yard dash and the 4x100 relay.
										
										When I received my peronal trainer certifiction I got my first job as a trainer at Squeeze Studio Fitness. While working there I started developing and growing as fitness instructor and motivator leading group clasess and having one on one sessions. While working as a physical therapist aide I've worked with a wide range of people, from our senior community to young adults. I've also worked as a speed and agility coach for a young basketball camp called Hoopz 4 Kidz.
										
										It bring me joy to help my clients reach their fitness goals and it FIRES ME UP to see them put all excuses aside and go for new challenges. My heart is to see the whole person do well, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. As I help you on your journey to a healthier lifestyle I like to share what I'm reaching for in my life to make me a better coach for my clients. After all to reach goals in your life it's good thing to have accountability and positive people in your life to inspire you along the way.
