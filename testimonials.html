                                    <p> Fred makes hard work fun; he pushes while encourages and motivates while believing in you. He's open to trying new things and providing an exercise program that not only works on your goals but on you as a whole. Very highly recommend this great CPT! <br />Tiffary A. Physical Therapist</p>

				                   <p>I met Fred Carter at the Hoop for Kid's at the COA building on Burleigh where my son goes to learn basketball. Normally parents just sit around talking and looking at there kids playing basketball. That's when I learn about Fred and his workouts for parents. The first class I attended was brutal it pushed me past my limits in a very good way. I'm 41 years of age with a total shoulder replacement. Fred made sure I didn't go past my shoulder limits and I still got a powerful workout. After the class he gave me some workout and dieting tips that were very effective. So before the next class I practice some of the workout tips. Which he noticed the difference in the next class I attended. I would definitely recommend taking Fred Carter class if your trying to get in shape. It pushes you in the right way, and he takes care of you if you have any injuries. This guy knows his stuff! Im looking forward to more workout sessions with Fred in the future. <br />H. Jackson</p>
